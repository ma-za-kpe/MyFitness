### Status: ðŸš§ In progress ðŸš§
A not so simple MVVM fitness app. Its completely offline, uses TypedArray to access and map the drawables to the data returned from the roomDB.
Experimenting with an offline first app.

This is a recreation of this app i bought on [code canyon](https://codecanyon.net/item/women-fitness-challenge-android-native-app/30024357#). 
Its created using java, what ive done is to recreate it using koltin and a few jetpack compose libraries.

### WHY?
Looking at other peoples code is sort of like peeking into there minds, seeing how they think. Thats why I love open source and encourage all
developer to contribute to it, youll be suprised what youll learn.
